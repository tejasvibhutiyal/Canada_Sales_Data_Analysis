# Canada Sales Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of sales data to uncover insights into sales trends, product profitability, customer segments, and regional performance. Using Power BI, we have created an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore various metrics such as average sales by year, quarter, and month, profit margins by product, and sales distribution across different customer segments and regions.

## Data Source

## Key Findings

- **Sales Trends**: The analysis reveals significant seasonal trends in sales, with notable peaks observed during specific months.
- **Product Profitability**: The Top 10 Product Profitability Analysis showcases products with the highest profit margins, indicating potential areas for increased focus.
- **Customer Segments**: Different customer segments exhibit unique purchasing behaviors, with the 'Corporate' and 'Home Office' segments being the most profitable.
- **Regional Insights**: Sales and profit distribution varies significantly across regions, with Ontario and British Columbia being the top-performing provinces.

## Interactive Dashboard Features
